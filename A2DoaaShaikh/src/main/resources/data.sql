('Antebellum', 'Antebellum was an interesting movie, but it adheres to overdone stereotypes without contributing anything new to the discussion of racism.
It feels like torture porn in that it is an extended portrayal of Black Suffering without making a point. The film appears to exist to make people uncomfortable,
but not in a productive way: that people view it hoping for scares is offensive. I think it is an interesting look at 
life in the South and it does shine a light on institutional racism, but I think the subject matter needed to be considerably more substatial and that the directors
needed to treat anti-black racism in the South more critically. The film could have contributed so much to modern discussions of race thanks to its place in popular 
culture, however it rings hollow and like just another attempt at shocking audiences with the rape of black women by white slave owners, not requiring audience members
to reflect on their privilege or contributions to the perpetuity of systemic racism in the West. It is easy to dismiss talk of racism, particularly when it surrounds 
slavery, by showcasing oppressors who we can look at today and label evil by our current standards - but showing the most extreme villains does not fully ground this discussion reality, 
because serial rapists and murderers were not the only people upholding racist systems; indeed, people we would label as "normal" or "tolerant" were guilty of this, as well. These extremes prove more useful 
in creating good horror rather than creating thoughtful films that encourage dialogue around the problem of anti-Black racism, which is my biggest gripe with Antebellum. You can rent this on YouTube.', '2020-10-02', '10:03'),
('Mulan', 'The animated Mulan was one of my favourite films growing up, largely because Mulan was the first female Disney character I ever watched who did not begin her story pursuing a 
nice young man. Watching Mulan reject archaic gender stereotypes was refreshing, and seeing Mulan feel comfortable existing as a man amongst men was honestly one of the biggest things that helped shape
my views of gender differences as a child. I also always really appreciated Shang as a character, because he is often taken to be coded as a bisexual man, which was amazing for Disney! The music (and Mushu)
made the film that much better, so when I heard that the new live-action Mulan had NONE OF THESE THINGS, I was already apprehensive. Then, I found out that the film was shot in Xianjiang, where 
genocide against Uighur Muslims is currently happening. I do not support this movie and I just wanted to write about how disappointed I am in this whole thing.', '2020-10-02', '10:03'),
('Sonic the Hedgehog', 'I just think this movie was a mistake, but it is a mistake that has a place in modern cinema. If you grew up playing Sonic Games, you might be disappointed in Dr. Robotnik, because he 
looks more like Ace Ventura with a moustache (because it is Ace Ventura with a moustache). But still watch this, it is only streamed by Epix.', '2020-10-02', '10:03');
